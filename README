MP3Trigger by David Wicks

Simple wrapper for MP3Trigger serial communication from Arduino.
Also allows you to loop tracks

You need to place MP3Trigger in the right place on your machine
for Arduino libraries. On a Mac, that means MP3Trigger.h and
MP3Trigger.cpp are inside:
~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/MP3Trigger

Basic usage will look like the following:

#include <MP3Trigger.h>
MP3Trigger trigger;
void setup()
{
//start serial communication with the trigger (over Serial)
trigger.setup();
//start looping TRACK001.MP3
trigger.setLooping(true,1);
}

void loop()
{
//necessary to receive signals from trigger
trigger.update();
}

If you aren't able to compile because Arduino can't file WProgram.h, try changing the include statement in MP3Trigger.h to:
#include "WProgram.h"

I don't know why, but it seems like recent versions of Arduino moved the location of WProgram.h.
Used to be in the system header search paths <>, now seems to have moved to the user search path "".

Have a look at the Arduino docs on writing a library:
